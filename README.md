# Container Images for Toolbox
My personal container images for [Toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox).

I'm using Fedora SilverBlue with my custom configuration. That means that I have a bit special requirements for the containers. Having `Containerfile`s will enable me to easily rebase to a new base image and also I know what is installed where. Anyone is welcome to use this for inspiration :).
